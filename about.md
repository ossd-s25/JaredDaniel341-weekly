Hi, my name is Jared! I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology. I'm excited to take Open Source Software Development
since it will expose me to real world collaboration and improve my proficiency in using git.

### Interests

I've recently taken a liking to web development after taking Applied Internet Technology and am familiar with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I also occasionally
dabble in game development and like working on small games.

### Fun Facts

I play video games, and I also like making music inspired by them. Additionally, I play the piano a little bit. I've also started learning about 3D modeling
recently using Blender.
